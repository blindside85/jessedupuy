    Hey. I'm Jesse- nice to meet you! I'm a cloud engineer and web developer
    with a love for all things tech. My journey started with a passion for
    graphic design, but everything changed when I discovered javascript. From
    that point on, I was hooked, diving headfirst into the world of coding and
    web development.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've spent over a decade exploring and mastering various aspects of the tech
    world, but when I'm not knee-deep in code, you can find me jamming out on my
    guitar and drums. Music is a huge part of my life, and I love the technical
    challenge and creative outlet it provides. I'm also an avid hiker and
    kettlebell enthusiast - there's nothing like a good hike or workout to clear
    the mind and keep the body in check.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts, musicians, and fitness
    buffs. Whether you're here to talk tech, share music tips, or discuss the
    best hiking trails, I'm all ears. Thanks for stopping by!
